You need to suggest new short concepts.
Below is a list of existing concepts with scores — a higher score means the concept better represents the underlying idea:
{concept_list}
Generate new short concept that you think would best capture the essence or meaning behind the given ones.
Focus on finding the most fitting, distinctive, or unifying concept. You can mix or combine ideas, generalize, specialize, rephrase, or simplify them.
Be creative — it’s okay if your suggestion is a bit off or experimental.
Keep the new concept very short (ideally one to three words).
Answer only with the concept.
