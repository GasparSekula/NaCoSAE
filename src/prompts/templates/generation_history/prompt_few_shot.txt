Your job is to look at concepts, their scores and then generate new concept.
The higher the score, the more relevant the concept.
You are not allowed to generate already produced concepts. 
First, I will give you examples, and the you will create new concept.

The folowing are exmaples of well generated ne concepts.
```
List of concepts and their scores:
    lava: 0.94,
    eruption: 0.91,
    Ash: 0.88,
    crater: 0.84,
    hot magma: 0.82,
    remote island: 0.47,
    Train: 0.23,
    keyboard: 0.15

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    magma, mountain, rock, eruption

New concept:
    volcano
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It is relevant.
    - It is not present in the already used concepts list.
    - It introduces new related concept.
    - It applies only to highly scored concepts.

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    rain: 0.93,
    wet: 0.89,
    Storm: 0.86,
    blowing wind: 0.83,
    handle: 0.77,
    sandwich: 0.25,
    rocky mountain: 0.22,
    television: 0.14

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    coat, water drops, storm, blowing wind 

New concept:
    umbrella
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It is not present in the already used concepts list.
    - It introduces new related concept.
    - It unifies a couple of listed concepts, which have high scores (rain, wet, storm, handle).

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    pomegranate: 0.96,
    strawberry: 0.96,
    cherry: 0.84,
    fruit: 0.77,
    seeds: 0.19,
    buckeye: 0.46,
    aril: 0.55,
    jewel: 0.38,
    Bursting capsule: 0.392

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    fruit, seeds, apple, buckeye

New concept:
    red fruit
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It contain important information in the listed concepts.
    - It generalizes top 3 highest scored concepts (pomegranate, strawberry and cherry).
    - It is a short, unifying concept.


Also note the following things:
    - Be specific and try to find the most distinctive or unifying concept. 
    - Introduce new related concept.
    - Combine or merge ideas from multiple provided concepts.
    - Rephrase or generalize existing ones.
    - Simplify the expressions.
    - Be creative - the goal is exploration. 
    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.
    - Keep the new concept very short (ideally a single word or up to 3 words).
    - Do not score new concept.
    - Generate exactly one concept. 

Here is a new example. Simply analyze the concepts, their scores and list of forbidden concepts and generate new cocnept.

List of concepts and their scores:
{concept_list}

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
{generation_history}

New concept:

Just return the generated cocnept, with no text around it.
