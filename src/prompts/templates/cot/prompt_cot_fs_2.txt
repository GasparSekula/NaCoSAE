You are an assistant that analyzes lists of concepts with scores and produces one new concept based on them.

You MUST follow this output format:
<thinking>
(Short reasoning. List 3 potential concepts, check them against the forbidden list, and select the best one. Max 3 sentences.)
</thinking>
<answer>
FINAL_CONCEPT
</answer>

Rules:
- The <thinking> section must be extremely concise (max 8 sentences).
- The <answer> section contains only the final generated concept and nothing else.
- You are not allowed to generate concepts present in the forbidden list.
- You must generate exactly one new concept.
- Keep the concept short (1–3 words).
- It must relate to the highest-scored concepts.
- It must generalize, unify, or creatively combine relevant concepts.
- It must not be identical to any forbidden or previously used concept (even if capitalization differs).
- Do not comment outside the required tags.
- The <thinking> section must be short.

Examples:

```
List of concepts and their scores:
lava: 0.94,
eruption: 0.91,
Ash: 0.88,
crater: 0.84,
hot magma: 0.82,
remote island: 0.47,
Train: 0.23,
keyboard: 0.15
You are not allowed to generate these concepts:
magma, mountain, rock, eruption

<thinking>
Top concepts are lava, eruption, and ash, which clearly describe a volcano. "Volcano" is relevant and not in the forbidden list (magma, mountain, rock). It effectively unifies the high-scoring items.
</thinking>
<answer>
volcano
</answer>
```

```
List of concepts and their scores:
rain: 0.93,
wet: 0.89,
Storm: 0.86,
blowing wind: 0.83,
handle: 0.77,
sandwich: 0.25,
rocky mountain: 0.22,
television: 0.14
You are not allowed to generate these concepts:
coat, water drops, storm, blowing wind

<thinking>
The high scores for rain, wet, storm, and handle suggest an object used for protection against weather. "Umbrella" fits perfectly as it has a handle and protects from rain. It is not on the forbidden list.
</thinking>
<answer>
umbrella
</answer>
```

```
List of concepts and their scores:
pomegranate: 0.96,
strawberry: 0.96,
cherry: 0.84,
fruit: 0.77,
seeds: 0.19,
buckeye: 0.46,
aril: 0.55,
jewel: 0.38,
Bursting capsule: 0.392
You are not allowed to generate these concepts:
fruit, seeds, apple, buckeye

<thinking>
Pomegranate, strawberry, and cherry are all red fruits. Since "fruit" is forbidden, I need a more specific descriptor. "Red fruit" generalizes these top items accurately and is allowed.
</thinking>
<answer>
red fruit
</answer>
```

Task:

Analyze the new list and produce a concept.

List of concepts and their scores:
{concept_list}
You are not allowed to generate these concepts:
{generation_history}

Produce your answer in the required format. Keep thinking very short.
