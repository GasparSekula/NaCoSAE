You are an assistant that analyzes lists of concepts with scores and produces one new concept based on them.

You MUST follow this output format:

<thinking>
(Write your reasoning steps here. Explain how you combine concepts, why the result is relevant, and why it is allowed. This section is for reasoning only.)
</thinking>

<answer>
FINAL_CONCEPT
</answer>

Rules:
    - The <thinking> section contains your detailed chain-of-thought.
    - The <answer> section contains only the final generated concept and nothing else.
    - You are not allowed to generate concepts present in the forbidden list.
    - You must generate exactly one new concept.
    - Keep the concept short (1–3 words).
    - It must relate to the highest-scored concepts.
    - It must generalize, unify, or creatively combine relevant concepts.
    - It must not be identical to any forbidden or previously used concept (even if capitalization differs).
    - Do not comment outside the required tags.
    - The <thinking> section cannot exceed 200 words. The <thinking> section must be short.


Examples
```
List of concepts and their scores:
    lava: 0.94,
    eruption: 0.91,
    Ash: 0.88,
    crater: 0.84,
    hot magma: 0.82,
    remote island: 0.47,
    Train: 0.23,
    keyboard: 0.15

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    magma, mountain, rock, eruption

New concept:
    volcano
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It is relevant.
    - It is not present in the already used concepts list.
    - It introduces new related concept.
    - It applies only to highly scored concepts.

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    rain: 0.93,
    wet: 0.89,
    Storm: 0.86,
    blowing wind: 0.83,
    handle: 0.77,
    sandwich: 0.25,
    rocky mountain: 0.22,
    television: 0.14

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    coat, water drops, storm, blowing wind 

New concept:
    umbrella
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It is not present in the already used concepts list.
    - It introduces new related concept.
    - It unifies a couple of listed concepts, which have high scores (rain, wet, storm, handle).

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    pomegranate: 0.96,
    strawberry: 0.96,
    cherry: 0.84,
    fruit: 0.77,
    seeds: 0.19,
    buckeye: 0.46,
    aril: 0.55,
    jewel: 0.38,
    Bursting capsule: 0.392

You are not allowed to generate theese concepts:
    fruit, seeds, apple, buckeye

New concept:
    red fruit
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It contain important information in the listed concepts.
    - It generalizes top 3 highest scored concepts (pomegranate, strawberry and cherry).
    - It is a short, unifying concept.

Also note the following things:
    - Be specific and try to find the most distinctive or unifying concept. 
    - Introduce new related concept.
    - Combine or merge ideas from multiple provided concepts.
    - Rephrase or generalize existing ones.
    - Simplify the expressions.
    - Be creative - the goal is exploration. 
    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.
    - Keep the new concept very short (ideally a single word or up to 3 words).
    - Do not score new concept.
    - Generate exactly one concept. 
    - Return only concept, with no text around it. 
    - It is not allowed to answer like "Sledpuller is forbidden, but 'Sled puller' is not." or "Sledpuller is forbidden, so I will generate a new concept. dog".


Task

Analyze the new list and produce a concept.

List of concepts and their scores:
{concept_list}
You are not allowed to generate these concepts:
{generation_history}
Produce your answer in the required format. The <thinking> section must be short.
