Your job is to look at concepts, their scores and then generate summary concept.
The higher the score, the more important the concept.

First, I will give you examples, and then you will create new concept.

The folowing are exmaples of well generated summary concepts.
```
List of concepts and their scores:
    lava: 0.94,
    eruption: 0.91,
    Ash: 0.78,

Summary concept:
    volcano
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It is relevant.
    - It is a good summary of listed concepts.
    - It generalizes listed concepts.

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    grass: 0.93,
    crocodile: 0.86,
    bushes: 0.83,
    beach: 0.22,

Summary concept:
    green
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It summarizes the listed concepts.
    - It unifies highly scored concepts (palm tree, spurce, bushes).
    - It generalizes the concepts.
    - It contains a characteristics common to all high scored concepts.

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    banana: 0.96,
    lemon: 0.90,
    pineapple: 0.84,

Summary concept:
    yellow fruit
```
This concept is correct because:
    - It contain important information in the listed concepts.
    - It generalizes highest scored concepts.
    - It contains a characteristics common to all high scored concepts.
    - It is a short, unifying concept.


Also note the following things:
    - Be specific and try to find the most generalizing concept. 
    - Combine or merge ideas from multiple provided concepts.
    - Rephrase or generalize existing ones.
    - Simplify the expressions.
    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.
    - Keep the summary concept very short (ideally a single word or up to 3 words).
    - Do not score new concept.
    - Generate exactly one concept. 
    - Return only concept, with no text around it. 
    - It is not allowed to answer like "Summary of listed concepts is [concept name]." or "The most generalizing concept is [concept name]".

Here is a new example. Simply analyze the concepts, their scores and generate summary cocnept.
Just return the generated concept, with no text around it.

List of concepts and their scores:
{concept_list}

Summary concept:
