You need to provide a short concept description. I am giving you a list of short concepts and their scores. A higher score means that the concept better represents or captures the underlying idea:
{concept_list}
Generate new short concept description that you think would achieve the highest possible score and best capture the overall meaning behind the given concepts.
Be specific and try to find the most distinctive or unifying concept. You can:
- introduce new related concepts,
- combine or merge ideas from multiple provided concepts,
- rephrase or generalize existing ones,
- drop weak elements, or
- simplify the expressions.
Be creative and don’t worry about introducing partially incorrect or unexpected ideas — the goal is exploration. Keep the new concept very short (ideally a single word or up to 3 words).

Answer only with one concept without score, e.g. "concept". 

Do not answer like "Proposed concept Based on the given concepts, I propose the new concept: "Unify". This concept captures the essence of the given concepts by representing the idea of with score of 0.504000.". Instead answer "Unify".
