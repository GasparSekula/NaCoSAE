Your job is to look at concepts, their scores and then generate new concept.
The higher the score, the more relevant the concept.
First, I will give you examples, and the you will create new concept.

The folowing are exmaples of well generated ne concepts.
```
List of concepts and their scores:
    "lava": 0.94,
    "eruption": 0.91,
    "Ash": 0.88,
    "crater": 0.84,
    "hot magma": 0.82,
    "remote island": 0.47,
    "Train": 0.23,
    "keyboard": 0.15
New concept:
    "volcano"
```

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    "rain": 0.93,
    "wet": 0.89,
    "Storm": 0.86,
    "blowing wind": 0.83,
    "handle": 0.77,
    "sandwich": 0.25,
    "rocky mountain": 0.22,
    "television": 0.14
New concept:
    "umbrella"
```

```
List of concepts and their scores:
    "window": 0.91,
    "transparent": 0.88,
    "reflection": 0.84,
    "bottle of water": 0.79,
    "fragile": 0.76,
    "cactus": 0.28,
    "engine": 0.21,
    "cloudy sky": 0.18
New concept:
    "glass"
```

These new concepts are relevant because:
    - They contain the important information in the listed concepts.
    - They focus on concepts with high scores. 
    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.
    - New concept is short (up to 3 words).

Also note the following things:
    - Be specific and try to find the most distinctive or unifying concept. 
    - Introduce new related concept.
    - Combine or merge ideas from multiple provided concepts.
    - Rephrase or generalize existing ones.
    - Simplify the expressions.
    - Be creative and don’t worry about introducing partially incorrect or unexpected ideas — the goal is exploration. 
    - Keep the new concept very short (ideally a single word or up to 3 words).
    - Do not score new concept.

Here is a new example. Simply analyze the concepts and their scores and generate new cocnept.

List of concepts and their scores:
{concept_list}

Just return the generated cocnept, with no text around it.
